\chapter*{Preface}

This will be the project report for the semester 4 project...\\
This project is a big opportunity to develop better skills in software, hardware and documentation. The goal of the project is developing a baby sized CPR doll to help nurses practice their CPR skills.\\ The project has been launched a few years ago, which means that most of the ground work was already done and the (global) working principle of the system is already defined and well documented. \\\\The focus of this report will be on the details of implementing the globally laid out system and on testing the units of this system. Which will be a big challenge and learning opportunity, since neither Richard nor Victor has done something with unit-testing and hardware integration testing, besides running basic examples.
