\chapter*{Preface}
This project was a big opportunity for improving skills in software, hardware and documentation for both of us. The goal of the project is developing a baby sized CPR doll to help nurses practice their CPR skills.\\ The project was launched a few years ago, which meant that there was already quite a start and the system's concept was realised. \\
\\The focus of this report is validate and integrate the the previous prototypes and subsystems into one system. This was a big challenge but we can proudly state that we made it to release the first real functional version of the babypatience firmware.

This project was an excellent opportunity for learning and applying embedded knowledge. Since neither Richard nor Victor has done something with unit-testing and hardware integration testing, besides running basic examples.
