\chapter{Summary}

The project aims to enhance CPR training by implementing an automated real-time feedback system in a modular baby CPR doll. The objective is to integrate and test subsystems, establish firmware version control, and ensure software quality through thorough testing. The architecture design outlines system structure, data flow, and connectivity interfaces. The technical design incorporates protocols for communication and selects the Arduino framework for development. The deliverables include a feature-rich firmware and accompanying documentation. Testing and validation are performed using various methodologies, ensuring system reliability. The project achieves significant milestones, including modular firmware, comprehensive testing, and essential data acquisition software modules. Overall, the project lays a strong foundation for CPR training test instrument system.
