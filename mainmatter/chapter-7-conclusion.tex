Where did the development of the embedded systems landed? What is realised, and finished etc. 
\section{Project Results}
This section lists the modules or parts that are realised. \\
In general this is the contribution or positive change that this project had:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Modular firmware with proper development organizational version control.
    \item Version controlled development environment with code standards.
    \item Crucial data acquisition software modules tested.
\end{itemize}
Note: The "(RESULT)" indicates whether the result was not a must have in the requirement list.
