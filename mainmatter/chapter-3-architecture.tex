\chapter{Architecture design}
\label{chapter:intro}
This chapter gives an overview of the system design on the highest-level. Abstraction is used to cover the details which are not essential to outline what the system does and how it works in the big lines. \newline
The architecture outlines the structure, components, and interactions of a software or hardware system. It is an essential element to understand the system.

\chapter{Technical Design}
This chapter translates the functional and the architecture into the real-world engineering implementation.

\section{Hierarchical/Abstraction Overview}
\section{Protocols Highlights}
For the details of the protocols, please consult the appendix. This section only covers the basics for understanding. and awareness of existence.  
\section{Engineering Decisions}
-- Here we should document things like why we are using I2S, SPI and testing framework Google Testing.
